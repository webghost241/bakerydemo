Wagtail demo project
=======================

This is a demonstration project for [Wagtail CMS](http://wagtail.io).

*We do __not__ recommend using this project to start your own site*. This project is only to provide some examples of
implementing common features, it is not an exemplar of Django or Wagtail best practice.

If you're reasonably new to Python/Django, we suggest you run this project on a Virtual Machine using Vagrant, which
helps  resolve common software dependency issues. However for more experienced developers, instructions to start this
project without Vagrant follow below.

Once you're familiar with the examples in this project and you want to start a real site, we strongly recommend running
the ``wagtail start`` command in a fresh virtual environment, explained in the
[Wagtail CMS Documentation](http://wagtail.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started/).

Setup with Vagrant
------------------

### Dependencies
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant 1.5+](http://www.vagrantup.com)

### Installation
Run the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/torchbox/bakerydemo.git
    cd wagtaildemo
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
      (then, within the SSH session:)
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py load_initial_data
    ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

The demo site will now be accessible at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and the Wagtail admin
interface at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/).

Log into the admin with the credentials ``admin / changeme``.

Setup without Vagrant
-----
Don't want to set up a whole VM to try out Wagtail? No problem.

### Dependencies
* [PIP](https://github.com/pypa/pip)

### Installation

With PIP installed run the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/torchbox/bakerydemo.git
    cd wagtaildemo
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py load_initial_data
    ./manage.py runserver

Log into the admin with the credentials ``admin / changeme``.

### Note on demo search:

Because we can't (easily) use ElasticSearch for this demo, we use wagtail's native DB search.
However, native DB search can't search specific fields in our models on a generalized `Page` query.
So for demo purposes ONLY, we hard-code the model names we want to search into `search.views`, which is
not ideal. In production, use ElasticSearch and a simplified search query, per
http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.8.1/topics/search/searching.html
