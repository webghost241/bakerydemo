Today, it is produced in many rural communities and sold in stores and by street vendors in Jamaica and abroad.</p><p>Bammies have been consumed since pre-Columbian times and is believed to have originated with the native Arawak people. For centuries, it was the bread staple for rural Jamaicans until the cheaper, imported wheat flour breads became popular in the post-World War II era.</p><p>In the 1990s, the United Nations and the Jamaican government established a program to revive bammy production and to market it as a modern, convenient food product.[1]</p><p>Bammy is made from bitter cassava (also called yuca and manioc in other American cultures). Traditionally, the cassava is grated and placed in a press bag (woven with thatch leaves) and placed in an outdoor press where heavy stones are loaded on. Once completely drained, but still a bit moist, the cassave is beaten in a mortar then sieved to a fine flour texture. Salt is then added to taste.</p><p>The actual baking of bammies varies across Jamaican communities. Traditionally, it is made by spreading a handful of the flour evenly in a baking ring on a flat iron or griddle on the open fire. While baking, the top of the bammy is patted with a flat board and then turned over. The baking process takes about 3 minutes and the final product is a thin, foldable bread about 10\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in diameter. This is similar to traditional tortillas of Native American cultures.

In France, not all long loaves are baguettes; for example, a short, almost rugby ball shaped loaf is a boutard (literally, bastard), or a \\\\\\\"torpedo loaf\\\\\\\" in English; its origin is variously explained, but undocumented. Another tubular shaped loaf is known as a fluobote, also known in the United States as a parisienne. Flu00fbtes closely resemble baguettes and weigh more or less than these, depending on the region.[citation needed] A thinner loaf is called a ficelle (string). A short baguette is sometimes known as a baton (stick), or even referred to using the English translation French stick. None of these are officially defined, either legally or, for instance, in major dictionaries, any more than the baguette. French breads are also made in forms such as a miche, which is a large pan loaf, and a boule, literally ball in French, a large round loaf. Sandwich-sized loaves are sometimes known as demi-baguettes or tiers. In France a baguette must weigh 250 grams (8.75 ounces), a batard 500 grams (17.5 ounces) and a ficelle 100 grams (3.5 ounces). Baguettes, either relatively short single-serving size or cut from a longer loaf, are very often used for sandwiches, usually of the submarine sandwich type, but also panini. They are often sliced and served with pu00e2tu00e9 or cheese. As part of the traditional continental breakfast in France, slices of baguette are spread with butter and jam and dunked in bowls of coffee or hot chocolate. In the United States, French bread loaves are sometimes split in half to make French bread pizza.</p><p>Baguettes are generally made as partially free-form loaves, with the loaf formed with a series of folding and rolling motions, raised in cloth-lined baskets or in rows on a flour-impregnated towel, called a couche, and baked either directly on the hearth of a deck oven or in special perforated pans designed to hold the shape of the baguette while allowing heat through the perforations. American-style \\\\\\\"French bread\\\\\\\" is generally much fatter and is not baked in deck ovens, but in convection ovens.</p><p>Outside France, baguettes are also made with other doughs. For example, the Vietnamese bu00e1nh mu00ec uses a high proportion of rice flour, while many North American bakeries make whole wheat, multigrain, and sourdough baguettes alongside French-style loaves. In addition, even classical French-style recipes vary from place to place, with some recipes adding small amounts of milk, butter, sugar, or malt extract, depending on the desired flavour and properties in the final loaf.</p>\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph_block\\\"}]\", \"locked\": false, \"expired\": false, \"first_published_at\": \"2017-02-10T13:00:22.180Z\", \"slug\": \"baguette-french-stick-french-bread\", \"content_type\": 19, \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2017-02-10T13:25:45.802Z\", \"introduction\": \"A baguette has a diameter of about 5 or 6 centimetres  and a usual length of about 65 centimetres (26 in), although a baguette can be up to a metre (39 in) long.\", \"has_unpublished_changes\": false, \"show_in_menus\": false, \"seo_title\": \"\"}",

In the 1940s, a Rockport restaurant owned by Bill and Melissa Smith called The Blacksmith Shop on Mt. Pleasant St. started baking the bread for their restaurant in a small bakery on Main St. They baked about 80 loaves a day until 1956, when they built a modern $250,000 bakery on Pooles Lane.

One day, because of weather or other circumstances, he came home just prior to lunch time. His wife, Anna, was out. He sat down and opened his lunch box to find the usual cornmeal mush. He sighed and said, \\\\\\\"Anna, damn her,\\\\\\\" as he resolutely reached for the flour, molasses and yeast which he added to the cornmeal mush. His resulting bread became a local favorite.</p><p>Recipe: Put in a large mixing bowl 2 cups boiling water and 1/2 cup cornmeal. Stir thoroughly. Let stand one hour. Add 1/2 cup molasses, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 tablespoon butter. Put in a small bowl 1/2 cup lukewarm water and 1 package yeast. When dissolved, add to the cornmeal. Stir in 4 1/2 cups flour. Beat thoroughly and let rise until double in bulk. Add enough more flour to make the dough just firm enough to knead. Shape into loaves and put into buttered pans. Let rise until almost double. Bake about 50 minutes at 350. Makes 2 loaves.

The Meiji era was a period in which Japan was becoming increasingly westernized, and many samurai who lost their jobs were given work that was totally new to them. The Western role of baker was one such job.</p><p>One day, while wandering around the area where many people employed in Western jobs worked, Kimura Yasubei found a young man making breads and an idea was born; the starting of the bakery named Bun'eidu. In 1874, He moved to Ginza and renamed the bakery Kimuraya. At that time, however, the only recipe for bread known in Japan was for making a salty and sour-tasting bread, ill-suited to Japanese tastes at the time. Yasubei wanted to make a bread that was more to Japanese tastes. Finally, he figured out how to make bread in the way of the Japanese manju u2013 raising the dough with the traditional sakadane liquid yeast. He then filled the bread with a bean paste wagashi and sold anpan as snacks. Anpan was very popular, not only because of its taste, but also because the Japanese were interested in anything new and foreign at this time.</p><p>Later, a man called Yamaoka Tesshu016b, a chamberlain of the Meiji emperor, who loved anpan, asked the Tokugawas, the rulers of Japan before the Meiji Period, to present anpans to the emperor when visiting him. So the Tokugawas asked Yasubei to make some for the emperor. Yasubei worked hard to make the anpan and, because he also cared about their appearance, he decorated them with a salt-pickled sakura in the middle of each bun. This anpan was presented to the Meiji emperor on April 4, 1875. The Emperor told Yasubei to present him anpan every day, and because of the rumor that the Emperor ate anpan, the popularity of bread, and especially anpan, began spreading around the country.</p>\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph_block\\\"}]\", \"locked\": false, \"expired\": false, \"first_published_at\": \"2017-02-10T13:00:21.931Z\", \"slug\": \"anpan\", \"content_type\": 19, \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2017-02-10T13:06:34.394Z\", \"introduction\": \"Anpan was first made in 1875, during the Meiji period, by a man called Yasubei Kimura, a samurai who lost his job with the rise of the conscript Imperial Army and the dissolution of the samurai as a social class.\", \"has_unpublished_changes\": false, \"show_in_menus\": false, \"seo_title\": \"\"}",

Rye was also the most commonly used grain for bread up until the beginning of the 20th century.

There is no direct evidence of bread-making, but cereals have been crushed, cooked and served as porridge since at least 4,200 BC. During the Neolithic Period (3900 BC \\\\u2013 1800 BC), when agriculture was introduced, barley seems to have taken over to some extent, and ceramic plates apparently used for baking are found.

However, it is not certain that this bread was eaten; it could just have been a burial gift. During the Bronze Age (1800 BC \\\\u2013 500 AD), oats and the triticum species spelt seem to have been the most commonly used grains, and we see the first real ovens, probably used for baking small loaves and perhaps the first bread (probably around 400 AD).</p><p><br/></p>\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"image_block\\\", \\\"value\\\": {\\\"image\\\": 42, \\\"attribution\\\": \\\"Creative Commons\\\", \\\"caption\\\": \\\"Baking Soda\\\"}}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"paragraph_block\\\", \\\"value\\\": \\\"<p>Scandinavian soldiers in Roman times apparently learned baking techniques when working as mercenaries in the Roman army (200\\\\u2013400 AD).

Early Christian traditions promoted an interest in bread. Culturally, German traditions have influenced most of the bread types in the Nordic countries. In the eastern part of Finland, there is a cultural link to Russia and Slavic bread traditions.</p><p>In the Nordic countries, bread was the main part of a meal until the late 18th century. Four different bread regions can be found in the Nordic area in the late 19th century. In the south, soft rye bread dominated. Further north came crisp bread, usually baked with rye, then thin and crispy barley bread. In the far north, soft barley loaves dominated. During the 19th century, potatoes began to become the centrepiece of meals and bread was put aside as an extra source of carbohydrates in a meal. Bread still retained its key function for breakfast, as the open sandwich is a starter for most Nordic people today and potatoes are used as a centrepiece in lunches and dinners.</p><p>A history of Nordic bread from around 1000 AD and some contemporary types and bread innovations is presented below.

Further north came crisp bread, usually baked with rye, then thin and crispy barley bread. In the far north, soft barley loaves dominated. During the 19th century, potatoes began to become the centrepiece of meals and bread was put aside as an extra source of carbohydrates in a meal.
